# Introduction
This project aims to denoise retinal optical coherenece tomography (OCT) images , using a lightweight mimic autoencoder.
The method is detailed in ["A Lightweight Mimic Convolutional Auto-encoder for Denoising Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography Images"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399639)
